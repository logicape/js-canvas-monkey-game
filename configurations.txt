more to come


Abstracted plants and actors to arrays to spawn and unspawn many. 


Plant growth

The longer the stem, the more chance leaves will grow. The leafrate is always multipled by the stem length (in that direction). 

Created an array of leaves (leafs!) for each plant instance. They currently know thier location and they (supposedly) prevent themselves from doubling up. There's now a redraw() for plants.


Main actor growth & age
Introduced age and lifespan

At birth, 20 x 20 with a 10 x 10 core
Increase by unitGrowth x unitGrowth at each growth event (age/cyclePerGrowth).

lifeExpectancy: the cycle number where the actor will die
cyclesPerGrowth: the actor will grow every 'n' cycles


COLLSION! 

Can't run into trunks.
Can run (under) thru branches
Run into leaves = special: For now, they disappear
